        <h3> Oblivious - Kalafina</h3>
        <p>Such godly voices these vocalists make.
          It's truly a shame Kalafina disbanded. I hope that if they wish to continue they find new management, because
          a loss like this is just too much.</p>

        <h3> Shiki Ryougi <i class="devicon-visualstudio-plain"></i></h3>
        <p> is the main protagonist of Kara no Kyoukai. She is a girl who possesses the Mystic Eyes of Death
          Perception, a supernatural ability that allows the user to see the inherent mortality of everything
          (both living and non-living) in the form of lines. She assists the Garan no Dou agency in handling
          paranormal cases when combat is required
          Shiki's family, the Ryougi, were members of the Demon Hunter Organization. Their special skill involves
          creating two separate and distinct personalities within themselves. When a child is born, he or she is given a
          single name written in two different kanji, each one relating to each personality. Shiki's mother and father
          are unnamed. While she has an older brother, Kaname Ryougi, he was unable to manifest a second personality
          within himself, thus making him ineligible to succeed as the head of the family. Due to Shiki's success in
          manifesting her second persona and her older brother's inability to do so, she was chosen as the next head of
          the family and began her training in combat. When Shiki was young, her father took her to meet her dying
          grandfather. He told Shiki that people can only truly kill someone once in their lifetime, elaborating that
          those whom had killed many times are no longer human, fated to live with their guilt until their death. It is
          at this moment that Shiki learns to value the notion surrounding the weight and responsibility that comes with
          murder. Before passing away, he wished Shiki to have a peaceful death. By the year of 1995 as Shiki reaches
          the age of 16, the Ryougi family had effectively retired from the task of demon hunting, becoming a family
          similar to the Tohnos, in that they remained as wealthy landowners. In this case, they own a large
          Japanese-style mansion with a grove of bamboo beyond the outer wall. Shiki also took lessons in Japanese harp,
          flower arrangement, calligraphy, swordsmanship, jujutsu, and dance, as well as studying cooking as a hobby.
          Her academic ability is above average compared to Mikiya.
